# Agri-zone
I have created a UI for my website which can easily run on any operating
system. The integrated development environment i used is VISUAL CODE
STUDIO.
The programming languages i  used to create this website (user interface) are HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT
I have used the “react” library to build our website. It helped  to make the
website interface attractive and eye-catching.
In r src folder i created an ‘assets’ folder -which includes images and styles
folder and, i have a components folder which contains code of different
components of the website.
I have created a navbar and a footer in the components folder.
● In  navbar I have- “AGRI ZONE” (name of the
website),“PRODUCTS”(which would take the user to the featured products
& recommended products section), ”ORDER” (to the order form) , ”ABOUT
US” (to the about us section) , ”CONTACT US” (to the contact information).
● I created the product listing using react bootstrap’s cards, which
provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants
and options.
● To create the order form , i used React forms to allow users to interact
with the web page.
